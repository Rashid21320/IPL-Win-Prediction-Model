# IPL-Win-Prediction-Model (Machine Learning + Streamlit + Flask )

## Project Objective

  The objective of this project is to build a predictive Machine Learning model that forecasts the winning team of an IPL (Indian Premier League) match based on key match-related features such as venue, toss results, batting team, bowling team, and match conditions.
The project uses Logistic Regression to estimate win probabilities and is deployed using Streamlit for interactive predictions and Flask for a custom frontend UI.
This end-to-end project helps cricket analysts, fans, and recruiters understand how ML can be used in sports analytics.
